When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository allows easy sharing of files. Remote allows multiple distributed contributors. 
    Remote allows oversight of a projectfor open source or public projects.
    Remote allows online or offline editing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're working on code, if Git automatically made changes your code could break.
    It would also be difficult to resolve changes or this would be happening frequently.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is to copy an existing repository to your Git. Clone copies a remote to local.
    Branch tracks modifications to an existing reporsitory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With local copy of the remote master or branch, you can make changes offline and make separate commits.
    This allows for later merge with resolution of conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git, all work would need to be done online using GitHub. This will be less efficient.
    Without GitHub, you'd need to do your work locally then manually merge code into a central local 
    respository. It would be much harder than doing work locally.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would make changes in a separate branch to easily track new features or more significant changes.
    There might be cases where you'd interact directly with master locally. I don't know enough to comment.
