When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository allows easy sharing of files. Remote allows multiple distributed contributors. 
    Remote allows oversight of a projectfor open source or public projects.
    Remote allows online or offline editing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're working on code, if Git automatically made changes your code could break.
    It would also be difficult to resolve changes or this would be happening frequently.
